The provided code snippet is an interface definition for ReservationStoreInit in the @libp2p/circuit-relay-v2 package. This interface is used to configure the reservation store for a circuit relay server in Libp2p. Here's a breakdown of each property in the interface:
maxReservations:
Type: number
Description: Specifies the maximum number of reservations allowed. This limits how many peers can reserve a relay slot on the server.
Default: 15
reservationClearInterval:
Type: number
Description: Defines the interval (in milliseconds) after which stale reservations are cleared. This helps manage resources by removing reservations that are no longer active.
Default: 300000 (5 minutes)
applyDefaultLimit:
Type: boolean
Description: Determines whether default relay limits should be applied to a new reservation. This can include limits on connection duration and data transfer.
Default: true
reservationTtl:
Type: number
Description: Sets the time-to-live (TTL) for a reservation in milliseconds. After this period, the reservation expires unless renewed.
Default: 7200000 (2 hours)
defaultDurationLimit:
Type: number
Description: Specifies the maximum time a relayed connection can remain open. This helps prevent long-lived connections that could monopolize resources.
defaultDataLimit:
Type: bigint
Description: Defines the maximum amount of data that can be transferred over a relayed connection. This limit helps control bandwidth usage.
These properties allow for fine-tuning the behavior of the relay server, balancing between resource management and service availability. The defaults are set to provide a reasonable starting point, but they can be adjusted based on specific use cases and network conditions.
